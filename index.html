               <p>Hello i am Rajeshwar Patil! </p>
               <p>  Since my first attempt to make Robotic arm learn coordinates to paint vehicles automatically during my engineering days, to my first attempt to Automate a Software tests, even today, I am extremely fascinated and obsessed by Automation. I strongly believe constructive cognitive automation can do a great service to humanity and can drastically improve quality of our lives.</p>
               <p>Automated Software Testing is a challenging puzzle that I am passionately committed in solving. I have always enjoyed exploring Automation tools and have designed and developed innovative automated solutions/frameworks for various complex software projects and initiatives.</p>
               <p>I have enjoyed many interesting positions throughout my 14+ years career in Software Testing and Test Automation, ranging from a Test lead to a Technology Manager to an Architect.</p>
               <p>Not only I have worked as an Individual contributor but also successfully led a team of 35+ dynamic professionals, winning accolades in all the roles.</p>
               <p>Currently I am working as a Product Owner and an Architect for Test Automation tooling/framework needs in DevOps and DevSecOps. I own both Functional and Non Functional Test Automation tooling and Frameworks including Performance and Security Testing.</p>
